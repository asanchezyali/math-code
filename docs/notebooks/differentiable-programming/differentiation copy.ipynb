    "  A function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is **continuous at a point** $x_0$ if $$\\lim_{x \\to x_0} f(x) = f(x_0).$$\n",

    "In the following, we use Landau's notation to describe the behavior of functions near a point. We write $$f(x) = o\\big(g(x)\\big) \\quad \\text{as} \\quad x \\to x_0$$\n",
    "if $$\\lim_{x \\to x_0} \\frac{|f(x)|}{|g(x)|} = 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, $f(x)$ is much smaller than $g(x)$ as $x$ approaches $x_0.$ For example, $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ \n",

    "We now introduce the concept of derivative. Consider a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and a point\n",

    "f(x_0)}{h}.$$ In the limit of an infinitesimal $h$, the secant converges to the **tangent** at $\\big(x_0, f(x_0)\\big)$. The slope\n",
    "of this tangent is the derivative of $f$ at $x_0$, denoted by $f'(x_0).$ The definition below\n",

    "*Proof.* The proof follows from the definition of derivative. We have $$f(x_0 + h) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)h + o(h) \\quad\n",

    "f(x_0)| = 0.$$ Therefore, $f$ is continuous at $x_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to enabling the computation of the slope of a function at a point, the derivative provides information about\n",
    "the **mononicity** of $f$ near that point. For example, if $f'(x_0) > 0$, then $f$ is increasing near $x_0$. If $f'(x_0) < 0$,\n",
    "then $f$ is decreasing near $x_0$. If $f'(x_0) = 0$, then $f$ has a local extremum at $x_0$. Such information can be\n",
    "used to develop iterative algorithms to minimize or maximize $f$ by computing iterates of the form $$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\alpha f'(x_n),$$\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a step size. If $\\alpha > 0$, the algorithm converges to a local minimum of $f$. If $\\alpha < 0,$ it\n",
    "converges to a local maximum. If $f$ is convex, the algorithm converges to the global minimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "For several elementary functions, the derivative can be computed analytically. \n",

    "  The derivative of $f(x) = x^n$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\setminus \\{0\\}$ is given by $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$. In fact, we consider $f(x) = x^n$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\setminus \\{0\\}$. We have $$\\begin{equation}f(x + h) = (x + h)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} h^k\\end{equation}$$ Therefore, $$\\begin{equation}\\begin{split}f(x + h) - f(x) & = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} h^k - x^n \\\\ & = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} h^k.\\end{split}\\end{equation}$$ Dividing by $h$ and taking the limit as $h \\to 0$, we obtain $$\\begin{equation}\\begin{split}f'(x) & = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \\\\ & = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} h^{k-1} \\\\ & = nx^{n-1}.\\end{split}\\end{equation}$$\n",

    "<div class=\"remark\"><p>Remark 1.1. Functions on a subset $U$ of $\\mathbb{R}$</p> \n",
    "  For simplicity, we consider functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}.$ However, the concept of derivative can be extended to functions defined on a subset $U$ of $\\mathbb{R}.$ If a fuction $f: U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is defined on a subset $U$ of $\\mathbb{R}$, as it is the case for $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$, defined on $U=\\mathbb{R}^+,$ the derivative of $f$ at a point $x_0 \\in U$ is defined on a neighborhood of $x_0$ contained in $U$, that is, there exist $r > 0$ such that $f$ is differentiable on $x_0 + \\epsilon \\in U$ for all $|\\epsilon| < r.$ The function $f$ is then said **differentiable everywhere** or differentiable for short if it is differentiable at every point in the **interior** of $U$, the set of points in $U$ such that $\\{x + \\epsilon: |\\epsilon| < r\\} \\subset U$ for some $r > 0$. For points lying at the boundary of $U$, the concept of derivative is more subtle and requires the definition of **one-sided derivatives**, meaning that the limit in the definition of derivative is taken from the left or from the right. For example, the derivative of $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ at $x=0$ is not defined, since the function is not defined for negative values of $x$. However, the derivative of $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ at $x=0$ is defined from the right, and it is equal to $1/2.$\n",
